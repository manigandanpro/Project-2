### Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.  It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these 

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

**As you work through this notebook, follow along in the classroom and answer the corresponding quiz questions associated with each question.** The labels for each classroom concept are provided for each question.  This will assure you are on the right track as you work through the project, and you can feel more confident in your final submission meeting the criteria.  As a final check, assure you meet all the criteria on the [RUBRIC](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/37e27304-ad47-4eb0-a1ab-8c12f60e43d0/rubric).
